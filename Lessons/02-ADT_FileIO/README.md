# July 14, 2016 Discussions summary

### 1. Abstract Data Type (ADT)
### 2. Solving programming contest problems

**Try to enumerate other possible inputs and outputs that are not given in the _sample input and sample output_ of the problem specification**
 - Example problem: "Hashmat the brave warior"

**Input from and output to files (used in competitive programming)**
 - Look at folder "AreaProblem_DemostratingInputFromFile" for an example

Katung gi-ingon nako nga _"medyo mubo ang panan-aw sa mga Java developers sa .NET developers sa una"_ ... diri ko to nakuha sa statement ni Micah Martin: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/927502331

<blockquote>
In early 2005, I was on a small development team that began work on a .NET application to be written in C#...
<br /><br />
...
<br /><br />
Having participated in the agile community for years, I knew a good many agile developers who could help us. I called them all and asked them to join us. Not one of my agile colleagues ended up joining our team. Why not? Perhaps the most overwhelming reason was the fact that we were developing in .NET.
<br />
<br />
Almost all agile developers have a background in Java, C++, or Smalltalk. But agile .NET programmers are almost unheard of. Perhaps my friends didn’t take me seriously when I said we were doing agile software development with .NET, or maybe they were avoiding association with .NET. This was a significant problem. It was not the first evidence I’d seen of this problem, either.

<br /><br />
<strong>Throughout the process of putting this book together, I struggled many times with the concept of my name being on the cover of a .NET book.</strong> I questioned whether I wanted my name associated with .NET and all the negative connotations that seemed to come with it. Yet I can no longer deny it. I am a .NET programmer. No! An agile .NET programmer. And I’m proud of it.

**I don't know kung unsa ang _"negative connotations"_ about .NET nga iyang gina-ingon diri. Pero take note nga 2005 pa ni nahitabo. So dugay na kaayo. Karon, nangawala na siguro tung negative connotations assiciated with .NET.**
