### 1. A review of functions & arrays

**Functions**
 - http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_functions.htm
 - also read the "Functions" part of http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/absolute-basics-programming-beginners-part-2/

**Arrays**
 - http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_arrays.htm

**_NOTE: The tutorials provided above use C++. But we should not focus on the syntax of the language being used (because if we forget the syntax we can just google for them or look them in our notes; and we don't know what language(s) we will be using in the future). We should focus instead on the concepts or ideas that the tutorials present like:_** 

> "A function is just a group of code thatâ€™s been given a name. By grouping a block of code together and naming it, we can re-use it later and throughout the application without having to rewrite the whole code block again."

**_We can still use these concepts even if we use another programming language in the future._**
